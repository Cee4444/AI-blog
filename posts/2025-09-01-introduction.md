# AI's Future in Society: Dystopia or Utopia?

## Introduction: Why I’m Writing About AI
During this first half of this decade, we have seen rapid increases in the tasks AI such as Chatgpt have been able to contribute or complete at an exponential levels of skill. It has aided and made huge strives in numerous fields of work, predicting proteins shapes allowing us to dveloped drugs thats has increased the efficiency of treatments. Also, being used more and more in software enineering to generate code and review the lines of code they make which is saving developers substatial amounts of time. From this, hundreds and maybe even thousands of companies have taken an interest to invest in this ever evolving tool which is reshaping are lives constantly today. But, will this 'tool' remain at our command? Perhaps there could be a day where AI threatens the existence of the entire human population? We have already seen the negative affects creeping in to our society: job displacement, deepfakes and cyberattacks to list a few. There are many discussions between the largest companies and governments recently on how do we regulate such a powerful machine while utilising it to its fullest potential. So due to AI seriously affecting the future of world that I, you and we all live in, I have to decided to onsider on how we should go about controlling AI and exploring the possibilities of how our society could end up depending on how our goverments deal and respond to this precarious problem.
