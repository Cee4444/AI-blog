# AI's Future in Society: Dystopia or Utopia?
*Posted: September 1, 2025*

## Introduction: What effects has AI had on our society?
This blog explores how AI is creating different possibilities of reshaping society and argues that are future depends on the impact of ethics in regulation of AI. During this first half of this decade, we have seen rapid increases in the tasks AI such as Chatgpt have been able to contribute or complete at exponential levels of skill. It has aided and made huge strides in numerous fields of work, the AlphaFold project by Deepmind has used AI to help predicted over 200 million protein shapes [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](as noted in thehttps://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) allowing us to develop drugs that has increased the efficiency of treatments. Also, being used more and more in software engineering to generate code and review the lines of code they make, which is saving developers substantial amounts of time. From this, hundreds and maybe even thousands of companies have taken an interest to invest in this ever evolving tool which is reshaping our lives constantly today. But, will this 'tool' remain at our command? Perhaps there could be a day where AI threatens the existence of the entire human population? We have already seen the negative effects creeping in to our society: job displacement, deepfakes and cyberattacks to list a few. There are many discussions between the largest companies and governments recently on how do we regulate such a powerful machine while utilising it to its fullest potential. So due to AI seriously affecting the future of the world that I, you and we all live in, I have to decided to consider on how we should go about controlling AI and exploring the possibilities of how our society could end up depending on how our governments deal and respond to this precarious problem.
