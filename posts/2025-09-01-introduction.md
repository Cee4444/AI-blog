# AI's Future in Society: Dystopia or Utopia?
*Posted: September ?, 2025*

## Introduction: What effects has AI had on our society?
This blog explores how AI is creating different possibilities of reshaping society and argues that our future depends on the impact of ethics in regulation of AI. During this first half of this decade, we have seen rapid increases in the tasks AI applications, such as Chatgpt, have been able to contribute or complete at exponential levels of skill. Because of this lively progress in skill, it has aided and made huge strides in numerous fields of work. The AlphaFold project by Deepmind has used AI to help predict over 200 million protein shapes. This has further allowed us to develop drugs that have increased the efficiency of treatments. Also, AI is being used more and more in software engineering to generate and review code they construct. For example, Tabnine is an AI tool that supplies code completion and prediction for developers, which is granting these developers substantial amounts of time for more difficult and important tasks. However, critics may argue this could potentially create a skill gap between software engineering professionals. From these breakthroughs, according to McKinsey’s latest State of AI survey, 78 percent of organizations now report using AI in at least one business function—up from 72 percent earlier in that same year and just 55 percent a year before. This demonstrates to people how AI could be worth that risk, as they are pouring millions of pounds into these AI tools for the additional benefits it has on the economic growth of their company. But, will this 'tool' remain at our command? Perhaps there could be a day where AI threatens the existence of the entire human population. We have already seen the negative effects creeping into our society: job displacement, deepfakes and cyberattacks to list a few. There are many discussions between the largest companies and governments recently on how we regulate such a powerful machine while utilising it to its fullest potential. Given AI’s profound impact on our future, this blog will explore how society should approach regulating and controlling AI.
