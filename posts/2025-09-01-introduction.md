## What this blog is about
This is my first entry, inspired by *Basic AI* by David L. Shrier.  
Here I’ll explore how AI connects with my interests in encryption and scheduling, and reflect on the ideas from my A-level Computer Science journey.

## My reflection
This section is where I give my own opinion, link ideas together, or highlight what I agree/disagree with.

## Next steps
In future posts, I’ll cover:
- [ ] A breakdown of Shrier’s main arguments  
- [ ] How AI interacts with maths concepts I’m studying  
- [ ] Small coding projects that test these ideas
